***Chelonia mydas***

This is a project that aims to use Bioinformatic tools and course material to build up a Phylogeny and to filter out data, all this considering the *Chelonia mydas* species of Sea Turtles as organism of interest.

The *Chelonia mydas* also known as the green sea turtle is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle. Their diet consists of mostly seagrass and algae, which makes their fat greenish, feature that gave them thei name. 
Green turtles are found in the coastal areas of more than 140 countries where trafficking trade, recreational fishing, loss of nesting habitat from coastal development, and climate change are their biggest threats. However, the world has become conscious over their endangerment and developed measures to protect this majestic creature.

**[A]** In this project it was possible to zoom in on a Phylogeny for the species of interest as well as to  edit a Phylogeny using Figtree, for this the following was carried out: 


**1)** Download a data base file from the **Open Tree of Life** website containing the sequences to construct a Phylogeny using R-studio and zooming in the *Chelonia mydas* branch contained in the Chelonioidea Super family.

**2)** Using the same file to build a Phylogeny in Figtree.

**[B]** It was also possible to filter out data from RNA sequence of BRCA1 gen, using the following:

**1)** An fna file downloaded from **NCBI** databank

**2)** Regular expressions on Sublime to filter out unwanted text and denote the transcript section for the BRCA1 gene, which performs a DNA repair associated function in turtles.
